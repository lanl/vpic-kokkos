Introduction
============

Welcome to the Kokkos version of the Vector Particle-in-Cell code, VPIC 2.0!  VPIC is a 3D3V, fully relativistic, kinetic, performance-first PIC code for solving the coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann system of equations.

Getting Started
***************
Getting started with VPIC will be much easier when the documentation is complete!  For now, some build instructions are in :doc:`comp`, and some elementary run instructions are in :doc:`run`.
